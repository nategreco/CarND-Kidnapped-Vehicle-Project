### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.

My project includes the following files:
* [main.cpp](../src/main.cpp) main program that runs the IO server (given from starter code)
* [particle_filter.cpp](../src/particle_filter.cpp) contains the particle filter implementation
* [particle_filter.h](../src/particle_filter.h) header file for [particle_filter.cpp](../src/particle_filter.cpp)
* [helper_functions.cpp](../src/helper_functions.cpp) contains various helper functions for particle filter implementation
* [helper_functions.h](../src/helper_functions.h) header file for [helper_functions.cpp](../src/helper_functions.cpp)
* [Dataset1.png](./Dataset1.png) result image from simulation
